To Do Notes from Stew:
----------------------

- set up to use Gemfile and bundler (took me way to long to realise the error was from using rspec 2 not 1)
- write basic recipe to hit and check projects on a hudson server
  + add acceptance test for fixture xml file?
  + add server/project classes
  + add xml feed to project interpretation (use nokogiri? xpath vs css selectors flame war with perryn?)
  + add server to http request interaction (just httparty get it?)
- write up some notes about libusb install on various platforms
  + macports screwed up, homebrew seemed to work fine
  + think this was because macports version did not put all the headers/libs in the right place

Perryn's Existing Notes:
------------------------

- To use ruby-usb you need the libusb-compat-0.1
     - ??? make a new binding for libusb-1.0? - ribusb??
     
- sudo ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install blinky
     - might be a better way of fixing this?
     
- add rescue to usb.rb

- names of usb_control_msg parameters are basically piffle - just send data in them

- need to swap data around for some reason? low order byte * 256?

- Errno::EPIPE: Broken pipe - usb_control_msg
    why does this happen? endpoint initialization?
    
------------- ubuntu

no libusb-compat? came automatically in some other package

--------------- window





---- ribusb

none of above necessary - maybe libusb compat is still needed?
